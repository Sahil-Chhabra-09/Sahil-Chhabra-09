# 👋 Hey, I'm Sahil

I build fast, reliable, and scalable software—mostly in the world of React, Node.js, microservices, and AI-assisted systems.  
I work across the stack, from polished frontends to distributed backend pipelines, and I enjoy designing clean architectures that stay maintainable as products grow.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Frontend engineering with **React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS**
- Backend engineering with **Node.js, Express, microservices, REST APIs**
- Distributed pipelines using **Kafka**, event-driven services, and modular backends
- Performance tuning: bundle-size reduction, render optimization, caching strategies
- Designing responsive, production-ready UIs that work across desktop, mobile, and PWAs
- Building internal component libraries and reusable interfaces
- Collaborating with ML engineers to integrate AI inference into real-world products
